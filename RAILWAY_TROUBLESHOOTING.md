# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## If Railway can't find your repository:

### Solution 1: Authorize Railway GitHub Access
1. In Railway, click "New Project"
2. When you see the repository search, look for a button like:
   - "Connect GitHub Account"
   - "Authorize GitHub"
   - "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Click it and authorize Railway to access your repositories
4. After authorization, try searching again for: `RAG_Chat_Assistant_Django`

### Solution 2: Check Repository Visibility
1. Go to https://github.com/Shrvaani/RAG_Chat_Assistant_Django/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone" at the bottom
3. Check if repository is Private
4. If Private, either:
   - Make it Public temporarily (Settings → Change visibility → Make public)
   - Or ensure Railway has access if keeping it Private

### Solution 3: Manual Repository Selection
1. In Railway, after connecting GitHub
2. Instead of searching, manually browse:
   - Look through your repository list
   - Find "RAG_Chat_Assistant_Django"
   - Click on it to select

### Solution 4: Use Repository Owner Format
Try entering just the repository name (without full URL):
```
Shrvaani/RAG_Chat_Assistant_Django
```

### Solution 5: Verify Repository Exists
Check the repository is accessible:
- Visit: https://github.com/Shrvaani/RAG_Chat_Assistant_Django
- Ensure you're logged into GitHub
- Verify the repository is visible to you

## Still Having Issues?
- Make sure you're signed into Railway with the same GitHub account
- Try logging out and back into Railway
- Clear browser cache and try again
