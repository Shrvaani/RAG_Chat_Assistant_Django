# ðŸ”§ Railway Build Fix

## Common Build Errors & Solutions:

### Error 1: "Failed to build image"
**Solution:** Added `runtime.txt` and `nixpacks.toml` for better build configuration

### Error 2: Dependency conflicts
**Solution:** Pinned numpy version and added build requirements

### Error 3: Timeout during build
**Solution:** Railway will retry automatically, or check logs

---

## What I Fixed:

1. âœ… Added `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.9
2. âœ… Added `nixpacks.toml` - Custom build configuration
3. âœ… Updated `requirements.txt` - Fixed numpy version constraint
4. âœ… Added build requirements (setuptools, wheel)

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Redeploy on Railway** - The new config will be used
2. **Check Build Logs** if it still fails
3. **Common issues to check:**
   - Is PostgreSQL database connected?
   - Are environment variables set?
   - Check Railway logs for specific error messages

---

## If Build Still Fails:

Share the **error message from Railway logs** and I can help fix it!

Common errors:
- Module not found â†’ Add to requirements.txt
- Database connection â†’ Check DATABASE_URL
- Static files â†’ Already configured with WhiteNoise
- Python version â†’ runtime.txt specifies 3.11.9
